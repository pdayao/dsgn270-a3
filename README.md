Journal Entry\
* I was playing around with the ellipse tool and I liked how easy it was to manipulate the nodes to make different shapes so I wanted to see how much I could accomplish with it. I made a shape that reminded me of my dog's ear so I decided to see if I could make build my logo on that idea. The colour scheme is based on my cat's colouring (he has orange/white fur and green eyes). The triangle in the background I decided to add because it felt incomplete and empty (inspired by my pets' very triangular faces).\
* In terms of svgs, I'm still getting used to them. I spent majority of my time on this project watching the lecture recording and other svg videos while playing around with it.
